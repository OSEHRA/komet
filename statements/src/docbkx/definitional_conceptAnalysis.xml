    <title>Content Requiring Special Handling</title>
    <section>
        <title>Purpose</title>
        <para>The creation of groupings (RefSets) containing SNOMED CT concepts that require special
            handling supports the maintenance of this content over time without the necessity of
            re-reviewing the entire content. Within SOLOR, these various RefSets are imported and
            are properly grouped within the system. Subsequently, set of rules could be developed
            and applied to handle each of the cases appropriately. </para>

        <para>Concepts may require special handling for a number of reasons:<itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Hierarchies may be incorrect and could affect retrieval</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Concepts may require retirement or movement to the “Situation”
                        hierarchy</para>

                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist></para>

        <para>This document outlines the agreed upon rules, the reasoning for applying those rules
            and provides practical examples of how they are applied. Also, included are the
            inter-rater reliability metrics for the concepts evaluated and specificity and
            sensitivity metrics for the keywords used to find relevant concepts. </para>

        <para>The concepts identified in this task as either meeting inclusion or exclusion criteria
            belong to the following categories: <itemizedlist>

        <title>Special Handling Categories</title>

        <section>
            <title>Absence Representation</title>
            <para>Absence, where in the strictest sense within the description logic realm, is "NOT"
                and it means "everything but". If one were to express "not diabetes", it equates to
                "everything but diabetes".</para>
            <para>This is further complicated within SNOMED by the parent-child relationship "isA".
                Take the following figure as an example:</para>
            <para>
                <figure>
                    <title>Effect of isA on absence</title>
                    <mediaobject>
                        <imageobject>
                            <imagedata fileref="images/definitional_conceptAnalysis_negation_00.png"
                                scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%"/>
                        </imageobject>
                    </mediaobject>
                </figure>
            </para>
            <para>In a hierarchical structure, isA is a one-way pointer. If B is achild, and A is a
                parent, that means B isA A. However, one cannot flip that relationship. For example,
                one can express that one is "having an apple", and by the definition of isA, one can
                assume that one is "having a fruit" (apple is a fuit). However, this directionality
                cannot be flipped because "having a fruit" does not necessarily mean that one is
                "having an apple".</para>
            <para>In a separate example, what if "No apple" is a child of "No fruit"? If one were
                having "no apple", it doesn't necessarily mean that one is having "no fruit" (one
                could very well have other fruits). However, in this scenario, if one were to
                express having "no fruit", one could deduce that one is also having "no apple". Note
                the directionality of the isA in this scenario, which is opposite of the previous
                example.</para>
            <para>Not shown in the figure, but what if "No apple" is a child of "Fruit"?</para>
            <para>Although simplistic, this example shows how absence concept in a hierarchical
                structure significantly complicates any calculations. Without a way to properly
                identify if a concept is a 'absence' concept, computational methods could not be
                applied because the directionality as shown with the apple/fruit example would
                complicate any calculations.Therefore, it was deemed necessary that such "absent"
                concepts within SNOMED required identification such that they can be segragated for
                further special handling.</para>
            <para>“Absence” vs. “Affirmation” are two polar opposite paradigms within the SNOMED CT
                Concept Model. Where “Affirmation” represents a statement that e.g. a finding or a
                disorder is present, absent states their absence.</para>
            <para>However, in SNOMED, the expression of "no diabetes" is a positive assertion that
                something is not present. This is different than "everything but diabetes". <annotation>
                    <para>reference separation of concern when it is available</para>
                </annotation> As a result, these two potentially different semantics could lead to
                confusion and delay if one were to apply computational methods - does "No diabetes"
                mean "everything but diabetes" or "diabetes is not present"?</para>

            <para>65124004 |Swelling (finding)| vs. 300890009 |Swelling absent (situation)|</para>
            <para>“absence” concepts are generally located in the “situation with explicit context”
                hierarchy, where the Context terminological model is consistently applied. Concepts
                including or implying absence, which are located outside this hierarchy pose
                challenges for the logical semantic hierarchies they reside in. This study focused
                only on identifying concepts that are currently not located within the “situation
                with explicit context” hierarchy. Some of these identified concepts may need to be
                relocated to the situation hierarchy as a result of this project.</para>
            <para>Currently the logical hierarchy for absence concepts remains “upside-down”.</para>

            <para>162298006 |No headache (situation)| is a subtype of 81765008 |No pain

            <section>
                <title>Approach</title>
                <para>The initial task was to evaluate 50,000 concepts and determine their potential
                    membership in one or more of the RefSets.</para>
                <para>For each of the RefSets for inclusion, word patterns that explicitly or
                    implicitly identify a concept as a member of the RefSet were developed. As a
                    first automated step, queries using string matching of those patterns or
                    keywords were applied to the following SNOMED CT hierarchies:<orderedlist>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>Clinical Findings</para>
                        </listitem>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>Procedures</para>
                        </listitem>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>Body Structures</para>
                        </listitem>
                    </orderedlist></para>
                <para>Based on the keywords, terminologists developed a set of rules for each
                    inclusion/exclusion to be applied to each RefSet. </para>
                <para>The sets of concepts that resulted from the initial automated query were then
                    assigned to at least two independent reviewers to confirm or deny RefSet
                    membership for each concept based on the rule sets. Disagreements between the
                    reviewers were extracted and analyzed to determine if the rules needed to be
                    adjusted in order to achieve maximum reproducibility. Adjustments included
                    clarifying rules, adding rules or in some cases eliminating ambiguous rules. </para>
                <para>Certain concepts such as “Dental referral - child (procedure)” or “Fetal
                    distress affecting management of mother (disorder)”, which were identified as
                    ambiguous to an extent, where inclusion or exclusion from RefSet membership
                    could not be determined were extracted and added to a separate RefSet.</para>

            <title>Concepts Where Patient Is Not Subject of Record</title>
            <para>The default context of SNOMED CT concepts as stated in the SNOMED CT Editorial
                Guide means that, unless stated otherwise within the description or the definition
                of the concept, clinical findings are occurring to the subject of record (the
                patient) and procedures are performed on the subject of record (the patient). </para>
            <para>The only exceptions are concepts whose description actually contains a specific
                context (e.g. father smokes), and these are all grouped in the “situation with
                explicit context” hierarchy. Concepts, where the patient is not the subject of
                record outside this hierarchy do not adhere to the guidelines. This study did not
                focus on the concepts within the “situation with explicit context” hierarchy as they
                have their context already identified using the context attributes.</para>
            <section>
                <title>Approach</title>
                <para>The initial task was to evaluate 50,000 concepts and determine their potential
                    membership in one or more of the RefSets.</para>

                    implicitly identify a concept as a member of the RefSet were developed. As a
                    first automated step, queries using string matching of those patterns or
                    keywords were applied to the following SNOMED CT hierarchies:<orderedlist>

                <para>The sets of concepts that resulted from the initial automated query were then
                    assigned to at least two independent reviewers to confirm or deny RefSet

                    adjusted in order to achieve maximum reproducibility. Adjustments included
                    clarifying rules, adding rules or in some cases eliminating ambiguous rules. </para>
                <para>Certain concepts such as “Dental referral - child (procedure)” or “Fetal
                    distress affecting management of mother (disorder)”, which were identified as
                    ambiguous to an extent, where inclusion or exclusion from RefSet membership
                    could not be determined were extracted and added to a separate RefSet.</para>

                combination of more than one observation. While these concepts do not necessarily

            <title>Laterality Concepts</title>
            <para>The purpose of the Laterality RefSets is to identify concepts that are not
                currently modelled with the correct body structure that utilizes laterality. This
                only pertains to laterality as currently represented in SNOMED CT, which is used to
                designate one or both of paired bilaterally symmetrical (or near symmetrical) body
                structures. It therefore does not apply to sidedness of specific body structures.
                For example 364006 |Acute left-sided heart failure (disorder)| is not a lateralized
                disorder since the heart is not a bilaterally symmetrical body structure. For more
                information on laterality vs sidedness, please see <link

                                right, left, or bilateral in the FSN but since it uses the term
                                “hands,” it would be considered as bilateral and evaluated against the
                                current SNOMED CT modelling guidance as stated above.</para>

                            <para>If the concept being evaluated represented sidedness of a

                                Not Include Laterality RefSet. For example, 111283005 |Chronic
                                left-sided heart failure (disorder)| represents heart failure on the
                                left side of the heart. </para>

                                considered to be ambiguous since their FSNs did not specify if it
                                was the lacrimal canaliculi of both eyes or the right or left

            <title>Inverse Concepts</title>
            <para>The purpose of the Inverse RefSets is to identify concepts that <emphasis
                    role="underline">should</emphasis> have an opposing concept due to a description
                indicating an opposite or inverse concept, regardless of whether that opposing
                concept currently exists in SNOMED CT. It is <emphasis role="underline"
                    >not</emphasis> the purpose to identify and pair opposing concepts. In many
                cases, the opposing concept does not exist in SNOMED CT and the next iteration (not
                a part of this PWS) of this RefSet should be to link the two inverse concepts
                together to identify missing content.</para>

                            inverse since the opposing concept would be “Normal placenta affecting

                                the concept will be placed in the Can Be Fully Defined RefSet. For

            <para>The results of this exercise show that the rules for the “Compound Observation”
                RefSet appear to be the most reproducible. The numbers for “Absence” and “Patient

            <para>However, considering that the second team of reviewers have not been part of the
                previous discussions around the inclusion/exclusion criteria and were only given the

            <para>A number of keywords, which had initially been used to manually identify “absence”

            <para>Examining the actual concepts containing these keywords in appeared that, although

            <para>During the initial discussion and reviews of candidate concepts for this RefSet,
                the following rules had been stated:</para>
            <para>
                <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>

                <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>Concept is about patient’s family, family members, friends or other
                            social contacts, even if it is the patient’s family members, friends or

                    </listitem>
                </itemizedlist>
            </para>
            <para>Discussions about the kinds of concepts in 1 and 2 (above) resulted in excluding
                them. A concept pertaining to a “sample” was agreed as still being about the
                patient, because the sample is sourced from the patient. The same reasoning was
                applied to the pattern of concepts about objects or devices because, e.g. the
                “catheter” is seen in the patient’s body.</para>
            <para>This reasoning lead to leaving a single rule for inclusion in this RefSet:
                        <emphasis><emphasis role="bold">Concept is about patient’s family, family
                        members, friends or other social contacts, even if it is the patient’s
                        family members, friends or other social
                contacts.</emphasis></emphasis></para>

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        
        <para>The reproducibility of the rules stated and applied during the two manual review
            cycles was perceived positive. </para>

        <para>For "Absence", "Patient not subject" and "Compound Observation" RefSets, the set of keywords for automated queries
            returned results with a high rate of Specificity. The Sensitivity for the “Compound
            Observation” RefSet was also high. However, the Sensitivity of the queries for
            “Absence” and “Patient not Subject of Information” was lower. Identifying additional
            keywords may be useful to elevate the Sensitivity in those categories.</para>
        
        <para>The Inverse RefSets had good inter-rater agreement but the Fully Defined and
            Laterality RefSets had lower inter-rater agreement rates. The Fully Defined and
            Laterality RefSets both required the evaluation of the modeling of the defining
            relationships and judging their correctness. The experience of the clinical reviewing
            team with the SNOMED CT Concept Model is critical to getting a high inter-rater
            agreement rate when creating RefSets that depend on reviewing modelling. As the SNOMED
            CT Concept Model increases in complexity, the education and experience with modelling of
            SNOMED CT concepts will become even more critical in reviewing and maintaining these
            RefSets. </para>
        <para>For the 5,069 concepts that were identified as having laterality, 33.79% were deemed
            to be incorrectly modeled. While this is a rather large number, SNOMED International is
            currently modeling a large number of laterality concepts and this number should be
            decreasing with each release. </para>
        <para>The sensitivity for the Primitive RefSets is relatively low because reviewers needed
            to decide if the addition of some qualifier value or a new parent concept would make
            these concepts definable. In many cases there needed to be the addition of new concept
            model attribute to fully define concepts. The queries used to identify these concepts
            for review were not able to tell which primitive concepts could be fully defined with
            and without Concept Model changes. Overall, the exercise of reviewing primitives is very
            useful to identify more concepts that could be fully defined. </para>
                
        <para>Overall, this approach to identify SNOMED CT concepts that require special handling
            shows that automated queries can be very useful as a first “screening” step, but manual
            review and reconciliation still has to be performed to arrive at evaluated RefSets that
            adhere to reliable inclusion/exclusion criteria. Creating RefSets that identify modeling
            issues can present problems when the review of concepts spans multiple release dates and
            the tooling used to do the review is updated while the review is still taking place.
            This requires additional work at the end of the project to ensure that the review of the
