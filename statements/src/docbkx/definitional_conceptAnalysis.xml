    <title>Content Requiring Special Handling</title>
    <section>
        <title>Purpose</title>
        <para>The creation of groupings (Assemblage) containing SNOMED CT concepts that require
            special handling supports the maintenance of this content over time without the
            necessity of re-reviewing the entire content. Within Solor, these various Assemblages
            are imported and are properly grouped within the system. Subsequently, a set of rules
            could be developed and applied to handle each of the cases appropriately. </para>
        <para>Concepts may require special handling for a number of reasons:<itemizedlist>

        <para>This section outlines the agreed upon rules, the reasoning for applying those rules
            and provides practical examples of how they are applied.

            <title>Absence Representation</title>
            <para>Absence, where in the strictest sense within the description logic realm, is "NOT"
                and it means "everything but". If one were to express "not diabetes", it equates to
                "everything but diabetes".</para>
            <para>This is further complicated within SNOMED by the parent-child relationship "Is A".
                Take the following figure as an example:</para>
            <para>
                <figure>
                    <title>Effect of Is A on absence</title>
                    <mediaobject>
                        <imageobject>
                            <imagedata fileref="images/definitional_conceptAnalysis_negation_00.png"
                                scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%"/>
                        </imageobject>
                    </mediaobject>
                </figure>
            </para>
            <para>In a hierarchical structure, Is A is a one-way pointer. If B is a child, and A is
                a parent, that means B "is A" A. However, one cannot flip that relationship. For
                example, one can express that one is "having an apple", and by the definition of "is
                A", one can assume that one is "having a fruit" (apple is a fuit). However, this
                directionality cannot be flipped because "having a fruit" does not necessarily mean
                that one is "having an apple".</para>
            <para>In a separate example, what if "No apple" is a child of "No fruit"? If one were
                having "no apple", it doesn't necessarily mean that one is having "no fruit" (one
                could very well have other fruits). However, in this scenario, if one were to
                express having "no fruit", one could deduce that one is also having "no apple". Note
                the directionality of the isA in this scenario, which is opposite of the previous
                example.</para>
            <para>Not shown in the figure, but what if "No apple" is a child of "Fruit"?</para>
            <para>Although simplistic, this example shows how absence concept in a hierarchical
                structure significantly complicates any calculations. Without a way to properly
                identify if a concept is a 'absence' concept, computational methods could not be
                applied because the directionality as shown with the apple/fruit example would
                complicate any calculations.Therefore, it was deemed necessary that such "absent"
                concepts within SNOMED required identification such that they can be segragated for
                further special handling.</para>
            <para>“Absence” vs. “Affirmation” are two polar opposite paradigms within the SNOMED CT
                Concept Model. Where “Affirmation” represents a statement that e.g. a finding or a
                disorder is present, absent states their absence.</para>
            <para>However, in SNOMED, the expression of "no diabetes" is a positive assertion that
                something is not present. This is different than "everything but diabetes". <annotation>
                    <para>reference separation of concern when it is available</para>
                </annotation> As a result, these two potentially different semantics could lead to
                confusion and delay if one were to apply computational methods - does "No diabetes"
                mean "everything but diabetes" or "diabetes is not present"?</para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="underline"
                >Example:</emphasis></emphasis></para>
            <para>65124004 |Swelling (finding)| vs. 300890009 |Swelling absent (situation)|</para>
            <para>“absence” concepts are generally located in the 243796009 |Situation with explicit
                context (situation)| hierarchy, where the Context terminological model is
                consistently applied. Concepts including or implying absence, which are located
                outside this hierarchy pose challenges for the logical semantic hierarchies they
                reside in. This study focused only on identifying concepts that are currently not
                located within the “situation with explicit context” hierarchy. Some of these
                identified concepts may need to be relocated to the situation hierarchy as a result
                of this project.</para>
            <para>Currently the logical hierarchy for absence concepts remains “upside-down”.</para>

            <para>162298006 |No headache (situation)| is a subtype of 81765008 |No pain

            <section>
                <title>Approach</title>
                <para>The initial task was to evaluate 50,000 concepts and determine their potential
                    membership in one or more of the Assemblages.</para>
                <para>For each of the Assemblages for inclusion, word patterns that explicitly or
                    implicitly identify a concept as a member of the Assemblage were developed. As a
                    first automated step, queries using string matching of those patterns or
                    keywords were applied to the following SNOMED CT hierarchies:<orderedlist>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>Clinical Findings</para>
                        </listitem>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>Procedures</para>
                        </listitem>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>Body Structures</para>
                        </listitem>
                    </orderedlist></para>
                <para>Based on the keywords, terminologists developed a set of rules for each
                    inclusion/exclusion to be applied to each Assemblage. </para>
                <para>The sets of concepts that resulted from the initial automated query were then
                    assigned to at least two independent reviewers to confirm or deny Assemblage
                    membership for each concept based on the rule sets. Disagreements between the
                    reviewers were extracted and analyzed to determine if the rules needed to be
                    adjusted in order to achieve maximum reproducibility. Adjustments included
                    clarifying rules, adding rules or in some cases eliminating ambiguous rules. </para>
                <para>Certain concepts such as “Dental referral - child (procedure)” or “Fetal
                    distress affecting management of mother (disorder)”, which were identified as
                    ambiguous to an extent, where inclusion or exclusion from Assemblage membership
                    could not be determined were extracted and added to a separate
                    Assemblage.</para>

            <title>Concepts Where Patient Is Not Subject of Record</title>
            <para>The default context of SNOMED CT concepts as stated in the SNOMED CT Editorial
                Guide means that, unless stated otherwise within the description or the definition
                of the concept, clinical findings are occurring to the subject of record (the
                patient) and procedures are performed on the subject of record (the patient). </para>
            <para>The only exceptions are concepts whose description actually contains a specific
                context (e.g. father smokes), and these are all grouped in the “situation with
                explicit context” hierarchy. Concepts, where the patient is not the subject of
                record outside this hierarchy do not adhere to the guidelines. This study did not
                focus on the concepts within the “situation with explicit context” hierarchy as they
                have their context already identified using the context attributes.</para>

                    could not be determined were extracted and added to a separate

            <title>Laterality Concepts</title>
            <para>The purpose of the Laterality Assemblages is to identify concepts that are not
                currently modelled with the correct body structure that utilizes laterality. This
                only pertains to laterality as currently represented in SNOMED CT, which is used to
                designate one or both of paired bilaterally symmetrical (or near symmetrical) body
                structures. It therefore does not apply to sidedness of specific body structures.
                For example 364006 |Acute left-sided heart failure (disorder)| is not a lateralized
                disorder since the heart is not a bilaterally symmetrical body structure. For more
                information on laterality vs sidedness, please see <link

                            <para>If the concept being evaluated included a plural form of a
                                potentially lateralizable body structure in the FSN, the concept
                                would be considered to represent bilaterality and evaluated it as
                                such. For example, 248422003 |Warm hands (finding)| does not specify
                                right, left, or bilateral in the FSN but since it uses the term
                                “hands,” it would be considered as bilateral and evaluated against the
                                current SNOMED CT modelling guidance as stated above.</para>

                                were considered to be ambiguous since their FSNs did not specify if
                                it was the lacrimal canaliculi of both eyes or the right or left

            <title>Inverse Concepts</title>
            <para>The purpose of the Inverse Assemblages is to identify concepts that <emphasis
                    role="underline">should</emphasis> have an opposing concept due to a description
                indicating an opposite or inverse concept, regardless of whether that opposing
                concept currently exists in SNOMED CT. It is <emphasis role="underline"
                    >not</emphasis> the purpose to identify and pair opposing concepts. In many
                cases, the opposing concept does not exist in SNOMED CT and the next iteration (not
                a part of this PWS) of this Assemblage should be to link the two inverse concepts
                together to identify missing content.</para>

                <para>A consistent model needs to be developed and implemented to ensure Grades, Scales,
                    Stages, and Scores concepts are symmetrical. There are many possible options
                    available for creating a consistent concept model for Grades, Scales, Stages, and
                    Scores but the options outlined below can be accomplished without the addition of
                    new concept model attributes. It will require the addition of 254291000 |Staging and
                    scales (staging scale)| as an allowable value for Interprets. A large number of
                    Observable Entity concepts would either need to be retired or remodeled as subtypes

            <para>Discussions about the kinds of concepts in 1 and 2 (above) resulted in excluding
                them. A concept pertaining to a “sample” was agreed as still being about the

                applied to the pattern of concepts about objects or devices because, e.g. the

            <para>Leaf Nodes and Intermediate Primitives were concepts that were likely to be
                concepts that should be Fully Defined. However, in many cases that highly depended
                upon whether new Concept Model attributes could be added to SNOMED CT. The other
                Primitive concepts reviewed were non Leaf Nodes and Intermediate Primitive concepts,
                and not many of these expected to be fully defined. </para>

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        
        <para>The reproducibility of the rules stated and applied during the two manual review
            cycles was perceived positive. </para>

        <para>For "Absence", "Patient not subject" and "Compound Observation" Assemblages, the set
            of keywords for automated queries returned results with a high rate of Specificity. The
            Sensitivity for the “Compound Observation” Assemblage was also high. However, the
            Sensitivity of the queries for “Absence” and “Patient not Subject of Information” was
            lower. Identifying additional keywords may be useful to elevate the Sensitivity in those
            categories.</para>
        
        <para>The Inverse Assemblages had good inter-rater agreement but the Fully Defined and
            Laterality Assemblages had lower inter-rater agreement rates. The Fully Defined and
            Laterality Assemblages both required the evaluation of the modeling of the defining
            relationships and judging their correctness. The experience of the clinical reviewing
            team with the SNOMED CT Concept Model is critical to getting a high inter-rater
            agreement rate when creating Assemblages that depend on reviewing modelling. As the
            SNOMED CT Concept Model increases in complexity, the education and experience with
            modelling of SNOMED CT concepts will become even more critical in reviewing and
            maintaining these Assemblages. </para>
        <para>For the 5,069 concepts that were identified as having laterality, 33.79% were deemed
            to be incorrectly modeled. While this is a rather large number, SNOMED International is
            currently modeling a large number of laterality concepts and this number should be
            decreasing with each release. </para>
        <para>The sensitivity for the Primitive Assemblages is relatively low because reviewers
            needed to decide if the addition of some qualifier value or a new parent concept would
            make these concepts definable. In many cases there needed to be the addition of new
            concept model attribute to fully define concepts. The queries used to identify these
            concepts for review were not able to tell which primitive concepts could be fully
            defined with and without Concept Model changes. Overall, the exercise of reviewing
            primitives is very useful to identify more concepts that could be fully defined. </para>
                
        <para>Overall, this approach to identify SNOMED CT concepts that require special handling
            shows that automated queries can be very useful as a first “screening” step, but manual
            review and reconciliation still has to be performed to arrive at evaluated Assemblages
            that adhere to reliable inclusion/exclusion criteria. Creating Assemblages that identify
            modeling issues can present problems when the review of concepts spans multiple release
            dates and the tooling used to do the review is updated while the review is still taking
            place. This requires additional work at the end of the project to ensure that the review
            of the concepts for errors does not identify concepts that were correctly placed when
            they were initially reviewed, but are now incorrectly placed due to corrections or
            changes made to the latest release.</para>
