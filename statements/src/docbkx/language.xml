                and phrases that have alternate meanings. An example of a spelling variant would be
                &quot;Anesthetic&quot; in the US dialect versus &quot;Anaesthetic&quot; in the
                British dialect. The same word in one dialect can mean have a different meaning in

                    <para>However, rich synonymy may increase the chances that a given term may be
                        used to represent more than one concept (e.g., "cold" for "low temperature"

                        end-user selects "noncrushing" to represent "feathery". The concept accuracy
                        of "noncrushing" for "feathery" is adequate beause the two have the same
                        meaning. However, "noncrushing" does not fully express the character of
                        "feathery". </para>

                    <title>Balance between Precoordination and Postcoordination</title>
                    <para>There are one of two general approaches to representing knowledge domains
                        by clinical terminology.</para>
                    <para>In one approach, developers <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis
                                role="underline">precoordinate</emphasis></emphasis> (or enumerate)
                        all possible complex concepts apriori and essentially create a list of all
                        the complex concepts that can be expressed. A strength of this approach is
                        increasing the chances a user will find a desired concept. Disadvantages
                        include making a terminology so large that search becomes burdensome, and
                        reduced flexibility in situations where the terminology does not contain
                        concepts that a user may need. </para>
                    <para>An alternative is <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="underline"
                                >postcoordination</emphasis></emphasis> in which users compose
                        complex concepts by assembling general concepts and modifiers as needed. An
                        advantage is increased flexibility for representing a wide range of
                        concepts. Disadvanatges include increased variation and inconsistent
                        application of terminologies against clinical data, increased ability to
                        create nonsensical complex concepts from modifiers and concepts, and
                        inefficiency since postcoordination processes can be time-consuming. </para>
                    <para>Bringing these two approaches together can optimize a terminology's
                        flexibility, ease of use, and overall coverage. "Compositional balance"
                        makes concept selection tasks efficient by reducing the effort to assemble
                        complex concetps from general concepts, and reducing the time needed to
                        search through long lists of precoordinated concepts. </para>

                        concept but does not specifically define it. The two major goals of
                        including assertional knowledge in an interface terminology are to enahance
                        usability and to improve documenation quality when using terminology. For
                        instance, assertional knowledge may help bring together clinically related
                        concepts and modifiers a user is likely to consider and document together.

                    <title>Formal Concept Representation</title>
                    <para>Ideally, a terminology is represented in a formal way to promote easy use
                        for automated data storage, management, and analysis. Description logics can
                        formally model and specify the relationships that exist among concepts and
                        modifiers and provide a structured representation of the knowledge domain.
                        For instance, in the following
                        <?oxy_comment_start author="rcholan" timestamp="20190528T234635-0400" comment="Need to re-create the following image."?>screenshot<?oxy_comment_end?>,

                    <para>The goal of interface terminologies is to optomize the user experience.
                        Increasing efficiency and clarity of data review are key considerations for
                        helping clinicians access, read, and understand encoded clinical data. A
                        simple approach is to use relatively colloquial terms and display common
                        phrases and words. More complex approaches include "auto-complete" features
                        - when a user selects a concept (e.g., "chest pain") and modifiers (e.g.,
                        "anterior", "dull" "present"), the system may leverage tagged terminologies
                        to generate the natural language sentence (e.g., anterior dull chest pain is
                        present"). </para>

                        components that share a common data model with EHRs or other computer-based
                        systems. With this approach, terminology content development and evolution
                        can be distinct from software iteration cyles and queues. </para>

            <para>The language used to describe a component must be concordant with the underlying

            <para>Having a consistent naming convention defined will assist with textual queries to identify duplicates when concepts are primitive and not able to be fully defined using relationships within Solor. Having a consistent way of representing Fully Specified Names will alleviate the issue of users creating duplicate concepts like &quot;Disorder of immune function&quot; and &quot;Immune function disorder&quot;.</para>
            <para>Consistent naming is also important to support effective retrieval.  For example, the SNOMED CT concept 386560004 |Glasgow coma score finding (finding)| has 13 children all with the string Glasgow coma scale instead of Glasgow coma score.  </para>
            <para>Another common issue is to add a synonym to a concept that is more specific than

                Requirements</title>
            <para>For a search engine to retrieve meaningful results, it must be able to understand
                common usages of everyday jargon, similar to how synonyms are used to help broaden
                the way to express the same word. This section describes several strategies used to
                help with a query.</para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Word variants</emphasis> – Similar to synonyms, word
                variants are used to express the same word. While synonyms are explicitly created as
                a term to describe a concept (for example, SNOMED's "Heart attack" and "Myocardial
                infarction"), word variants are utilized during searching to assist in finding the
                correct concept, rather than explicitly creating the term. Hypothetical example - if
                "kidney failure" is a term created for a concept, a word variant of 'renal' could be
                created for 'kidney'. Instead of explicitly creating a separate term of "renal
                failure", this word variant could be utilized during searching to find all concepts
                that have the explicit term of "kidney failure" when a user enters "renal failure"
                by replacing "renal" with "kidney". This would create the burden of creating all
                possible variant terms for a given word.</para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Misspellings</emphasis> – Certain terms are more commonly
                misspelled when searching over healthcare descriptions. The ability for a search
                mechanism to recognize them and to search over both the correct and incorrect
                spellings will help to identify the correct concept. For example, perineal vs
                peroneal and aphagia vs aphasia. </para>
        	<para><emphasis role="bold">Word order</emphasis> – Terms can be combined in different ways
                to mean the same synonym. The ability to search over a term in varying order of
                phrases is important. For example, Disorder of the eye vs Eye disorder.</para>
        	<para><emphasis role="bold">Components query</emphasis> – The importance of this searching
                strategy comes into play when a certain focus is desired for the search result. For
                example, in LOINC, there may be circumstances where a certain axis is desired for
                the search. Simlarly, a certain hierarchy may be desired when searching in SNOMED.
                For example, "cold" is a synonym of common cold (a disorder) in SNOMED, and also
                exists as "cold sensation quality" (a qualifier value). By allowing users to limit
                the search criteria (disorder vs. qualifier), the most appropriate query result will
                be returned to the user.</para>
        	<para><emphasis role="bold">Active and inactive</emphasis> – Concepts and terms will come
                in and out of use over time. This is often indicated by an active/inactive
                designation. In order to properly return concepts/terms that are active, query
                parameters must contain a parameter to designate if the query result should/should
                not return active and inactive concepts or terms.</para>
        	<para><emphasis role="bold">Regular
                    <?oxy_comment_start author="steph" timestamp="20190305T154320-0700" comment="It looks like definitions or explanations of this and the one below still need to be provided." flag="done"?>Expressions<?oxy_comment_end?></emphasis>
                - Regular expression
                <?oxy_comment_start author="steph" timestamp="20190508T114704-0600" comment="Should the first part of the sentence say &quot;Regular expression&quot; vs. &quot;Regular express&quot;?" flag="done"?>or
                regex <?oxy_comment_end?>is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern.
                This pattern would allow a user to retrieve results based on a certain pattern. For
                example "a|b*" would return all "a", "b" and other b's that fits the pattern such as
                "bb", "bbb", "bab", etc. Since the depth and breadth of regular expression is beyond
                the scope of this document, various syntaxes, usage and explanation can be found in
                many resources such as <link xlink:href="https://regexr.com/"/>.</para>
        	<para><emphasis role="bold">Grouping Results by hierarchy</emphasis> - This search
                requirement can be thought of as a complement to "components query". After casting a
                wide net, results could be a bag of various terms (common cold vs. feeling cold)
                that may be cumbersome for users to sift through if it is not organized in an
                orderly fashion. Therefore, if results are placed together in a logical grouping, it
                would assist the user in finding the appropriate query result. For example, in
                SNOMED, it may be worthwhile to group results by hierarchy (disorder vs. procedures)
                to allow a user to look for a result in a desired domain or in RxNorm where all
                Ingredient results are grouped separately from Semantic Clinical Drug
                results.</para>
