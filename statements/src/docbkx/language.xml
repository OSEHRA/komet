            <para>Typical medical terminologies, such as SNOMED CT and the International
                Classification of Diseases (ICD10-CM), use a hierarchical structure that organizes
                the concepts into type hierarchies. These type hierarchies provide a mechanism for
                indexing terminology within the system; however, such hierarchies have significant
                shortcomings. For example, this simple categorization neither defines sufficiently
                what a term represents nor tells how one term differs from another. It simply
                indicates that terms with the same parents are related, and that they are also
                different in that they were not given the same term code. This kind of
                classification scheme works well for a system in which a term needs only one parent,
                in which only terminology that is unambiguously interpreted by anyone using the type
                hierarchy is used, and, finally, in which minimal automated processing of the terms
                in the type hierarchy is required. In other cases, this mechanism has serious
                limitations.

                other cases, this mechanism has serious limitations. <?oxy_comment_end?>These
                limitations may contribute to the significant random errors in ICD-9-CM
                classification of hospital discharge diagnoses. Error rates between 20% and 29% have
                been reported in the
                literature.<?oxy_comment_start author="steph" timestamp="20190508T111915-0600" comment="Will this be made into a footnote when this is edited?"?>15-17<?oxy_comment_end?>
                If a terminology lent itself to automated consistency checking, perhaps these errors
                could be reduced. The most serious limitation of vocabularies that use only type
                hierarchies is their lack of a formal definition for each term. If each term in the
                terminology were defined formally, it could be used in a more consistent
                manner.</para>
            <para>Aristotle developed a method for defining new types within the type hierarchy by
                genus (the category of classification for a term) and differentia (the elements,
                features, or factors that distinguish one term from another); and for using
                deductive arguments to analyze the inheritance of properties of these new types.
                This kind of type hierarchy is called Aristotelian. An example of a definition that
                contains both the genus and differentia for the term PLEURAL-EFFUSION can be
                represented in English by the phrase “a pleural effusion is an effusion located in
                the pleural cavity and caused by a disease.” The genus is represented by the first
                portion, “a pleural effusion is an effusion,” and the differentia is represented by
                the last portion, “located in the pleural cavity and caused by a disease.”</para>
            <para>A little over 300 years ago, Leibniz developed the first system capable of
                computing the elementary concepts of which more complex terms are composed. This
                system, the Universal Characteristic, represented primitive concepts as prime
                numbers. It created compound concepts by multiplying primitive concepts together. If
                PLEURAL were represented by 3 and EFFUSION were represented by 7, their product, 21,
                would represent PLEURAL-EFFUSION. Leibniz’s system was certainly visionary, and led
                to his development of the first mechanical computer capable of performing
                multiplication and division.</para>

                that define terms by genus and differentia, which in turn will allow the development
                of automated methodologies to process the terminology. Comprehensive-logic-based

            <para> “Clinical interface terminologies support interactions between healthcare
                providers and computer-based applications. They aid practitioners in converting
                clinical “free text” thoughts into the structured, formal data representations used
                internally by application programs. Interface terminologies also serve the important
                role of presenting existing stored, encoded data to end users in
                human-understandable and actionable formats.”</para>
            <para>“Healthcare providers generally use interface terminologies to accomplish one of
                two tasks: 1) encoding clinical narrative into a structured form, or, 2) reviewing
                structured clinical information that has previously been encoded using a different
                terminology. In supporting such uses, interface terminologies must enable correct
                and rapid interaction between clinicians and structured clinical data, support
                facile use by healthcare providers through easy understandability, and integrate
                well with other clinical computerized systems in the environment (Rogers J, personal
                communication, 2003).1–4 The Rosenbloom manuscript presents an evaluation model
                defining and utilizing the attributes to measure interface terminology application
                system usability:”</para>
            <para>“Parameters [for metrics for an evaluation model of clinical interface
                terminologies] include concept accuracy, term expressivity, degree of semantic
                consistency for term construction and selection, adequacy of assertional knowledge
                supporting concepts, degree of complexity of precoordinated concepts, and the “human
                readability” of the terminology. The fundamental metric is how well the interface
                terminology performs in supporting correct, complete, and efficient data encoding or
                review by humans.”</para>

            <para>The language used to describe a component must be concordant with the underlying
                semantics of the object being identified. Therefore, there needs to be guidelines in
                place to ensure only correct terms are associated with an object in Solor.</para>
            <para>Having a consistent naming convention defined will assist with textual queries to identify duplicates when concepts are primitive and not able to be fully defined using relationships within Solor. Having a consistent way of representing Fully Specified Names will alleviate the issue of users creating duplicate concepts like &quot;Disorder of immune function&quot; and &quot;Immune function disorder&quot;.</para>
            <para>Consistent naming is also important to support effective retrieval.  For example, the SNOMED CT concept 386560004 |Glasgow coma score finding (finding)| has 13 children all with the string Glasgow coma scale instead of Glasgow coma score.  </para>
            <para>Another common issue is to add a synonym to a concept that is more specific than
                the concept itself. A concept should only have synonyms that accurately represent a
                concept and not any of

                children. If a synonym has a more specific meaning, a new concept should be

                Requirements</title>
            <para>For a search engine to retrieve meaningful results, it must be able to understand
                common usages of everyday jargon, similar to how synonyms are used to help broaden
                the way to express the same word. This section describes several strategies used to
                help with a query.</para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Word variants</emphasis> – Similar to synonyms, word
                variants are used to express the same word. While synonyms are explicitly created as
                a term to describe a concept (for example, SNOMED's "Heart attack" and "Myocardial
                infarction"), word variants are utilized during searching to assist in finding the
                correct concept, rather than explicitly creating the term. Hypothetical example - if
                "kidney failure" is a term created for a concept, a word variant of 'renal' could be
                created for 'kidney'. Instead of explicitly creating a separate term of "renal
                failure", this word variant could be utilized during searching to find all concepts
                that have the explicit term of "kidney failure" when a user enters "renal failure"
                by replacing "renal" with "kidney". This would create the burden of creating all
                possible variant terms for a given word.</para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Misspellings</emphasis> – Certain terms are more commonly
                misspelled when searching over healthcare descriptions. The ability for a search
                mechanism to recognize them and to search over both the correct and incorrect
                spellings will help to identify the correct concept. For example, perineal vs
                peroneal and aphagia vs aphasia. </para>
        	<para><emphasis role="bold">Word order</emphasis> – Terms can be combined in different ways
                to mean the same synonym. The ability to search over a term in varying order of
                phrases is important. For example, Disorder of the eye vs Eye disorder.</para>
        	<para><emphasis role="bold">Components query</emphasis> – The importance of this searching
                strategy comes into play when a certain focus is desired for the search result. For
                example, in LOINC, there may be circumstances where a certain axis is desired for
                the search. Simlarly, a certain hierarchy may be desired when searching in SNOMED.
                For example, "cold" is a synonym of common cold (a disorder) in SNOMED, and also
                exists as "cold sensation quality" (a qualifier value). By allowing users to limit
                the search criteria (disorder vs. qualifier), the most appropriate query result will
                be returned to the user.</para>
        	<para><emphasis role="bold">Active and inactive</emphasis> – Concepts and terms will come
                in and out of use over time. This is often indicated by an active/inactive
                designation. In order to properly return concepts/terms that are active, query
                parameters must contain a parameter to designate if the query result should/should
                not return active and inactive concepts or terms.</para>
        	<para><emphasis role="bold">Regular
                    <?oxy_comment_start author="steph" timestamp="20190305T154320-0700" comment="It looks like definitions or explanations of this and the one below still need to be provided." flag="done"?>Expressions<?oxy_comment_end?></emphasis>
                - Regular express
                <?oxy_comment_start author="steph" timestamp="20190508T114704-0600" comment="Should the first part of the sentence say &quot;Regular expression&quot; vs. &quot;Regular express&quot;?"?>or
                regex <?oxy_comment_end?>is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern.
                This pattern would allow a user to retrieve results based on a certain pattern. For
                example "a|b*" would return all "a", "b" and other b's that fits the pattern such as
                "bb", "bbb", "bab", etc. Since the depth and breadth of regular expression is beyond
                the scope of this document, various syntaxes, usage and explanation can be found in
                many resources such as <link xlink:href="https://regexr.com/"/>.</para>
        	<para><emphasis role="bold">Grouping Results by hierarchy</emphasis> - This search
                requirement can be thought of as a complement to "components query". After casting a
                wide net, results could be a bag of various terms (common cold vs. feeling cold)
                that may be cumbersome for users to sift through if it is not organized in an
                orderly fashion. Therefore, if results are placed together in a logical grouping, it
                would assist the user in finding the appropriate query result. For example, in
                SNOMED, it may be worthwhile to group results by hierarchy (disorder vs. procedures)
                to allow a user to look for a result in a desired domain or in RxNorm where all
                Ingredient results are grouped separately from Semantic Clinical Drug
                results.</para>
