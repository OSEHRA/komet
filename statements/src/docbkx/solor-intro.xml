            <para>Symbolic information uses symbols to represent perception, interpretation,
                communication, knowledge, facts, data, and planning. Symbolic information is
                specifically concerned with symbolic representation and interpretational infrastructure.<footnote>
                    <para>http://science.jeksite.org/info1/pages/page2.htm</para>
                </footnote></para>
            <para>An interpretational infrastructure establishes meaning, value, and usefulness for the
                symbols, and can generate and decode the symbols. Without consistent meaning of the
                symbols, there can be no stable knowledge, facts, or data. After the initial assignment
                or development of meaning, the interpretation of symbols must remain consistent if the
                symbols are to be used for perception, memory, communication, or planning.</para>
            <para>Symbols have no meaning or usefulness without an interpretational infrastructure.
                Because the symbols and the interpretational infrastructure are both essential, they
                must develop or evolve together.</para>

            <para> RE-introduce the notion of informatics architecture. Re-iterate that this chapter
                is about the foundational level of the stack. The description of the foundational
                layer will follow [this is a black box to me]. </para>
            <para> The section that follows will include SOLOR and how it helps the foundational

                will be dicussed. Finally, SOLOR's front-end knowledge management enivornment will

            <para>A recent whitepaper<footnote>
                    <para>John D. Amore, et. al; “Interoperability Progress and Remaining Data
                        Quality Barriers of Certified Health Information Technologies”, July 6,
                        2018</para>
                </footnote> cited that great strides have been made in healthcare data
                interoperability in the past decade…the vast majority of clinicians and patients
                have access to some portion of their health data in electronic format, thanks to the
                proliferation of electronic health record (EHR) systems installed in clinical care
                environments. The data in these EHRs usually follow HL7’s Consolidated Clinical
                Document Architecture (C-CDA) as it has become the generally accepted primary data
                standard for structured clinical data exchange.</para>

            <para>However, the whitepaper also found that significant gaps exist in the accurate
                encoding of the data contained in those C-CDA documents – in an analysis conducted
                of C-CDA documents produced by various EHR vendors and clinical organizations, the
                four most frequent problems identified as part of this analysis were that
                medications should be encoded in RxNorm (frequency of medication appearing in 13.7%
                of sampled test case documents), vital signs and results should use LOINC (9.2% of
                sampled documents), vital signs, and results should use unified code of units of
                measure (UCUM) for physical values (8.7% of sampled documents) and the inclusion of
                conflicting status information for medications (6.7% of sampled documents)<footnote>
                    <para>Ibid, Page 6</para>
                </footnote>.</para>
            <para> These issues can have a direct impact on patient safety and point to the need to
                be able to consistently represent and encode clinical data and observations. This is
                the next great challenge to conquer for health data interoperability to positively
                influence patient outcomes nationwide through clinical decision support. </para>
            <para> SOLOR (System of Logical Representation) is an effort that is directly tackling
                these issues of representation. SOLOR is an integrated medical terminology system,
                based on the overlapping but distinct terminology systems of SNOMED, LOINC and
                RxNorm. SOLOR was designed to unambiguously define what can be measured (concepts).
                Working hand in hand with SOLOR, there needs to be a clinical statement model, of
                which there are quite a few (HL7 FHIR, CIMI, ANF) which defines how to record a
                measurement. Measurements may be quantitative or existential. </para>
            <para>The following diagram shows how SOLOR and clinical statement models are
                interrelated in the architectural stack: <figure>
