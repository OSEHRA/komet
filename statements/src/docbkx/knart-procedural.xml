        <title>Procedural Knowledge</title>
        <para>As with Assertional Knowledge, the representation of Procedural Knowledge reaches
            beyond the documentation of procedures requested or performed on the subject of record.
            Procedural Knowledge can pertain to, e.g. </para>
        <para>• Standard ways of performing a procedure</para>
        <para>• Treatment protocols for diseases</para>
        <para>• Standard evidence-based Order Sets</para>
        <para>Applied Procedural Knowledge can enable the use of

        <title>Treatement Protocols</title>
        <para>Standardized treatement protocols decreases variability and improves the quality of clinical care by simplify the treatment options, particularly in primary health care. Standard treatment protocols can be developed by preparing new treatment guidelines or by adapting or adopting existing national or international guidelines. </para>

        <title>Order Sets</title>
        <para>Order sets are a group of related orders which a user can issue that apply to a
            specified diagnosis or a particular period of time. Order sets reduce both time spent
            entering orders and terminal usage, helping to improve user acceptance of computer-based
            physician order entry.</para>

        <para>KNARTs<?oxy_comment_end?></para>
        <para>KNART is a Clinical Decision Support Knowledge Artifact and it's a structured way of
            documenting the content/knowledge for 3 different types of CDS interventions: 1) event
            condition action (ECA) rule (e.g., clinical reminder), 2) order sets, and 3)
            documentation templates (VA has called them SMARTForms or PNCS forms in the past). </para>
        <para>KNARTs are a standard HL7 format. While they are not the actual executable CDS
            interventions, they provide the information that a developer can take and then implement
            within an EHR. The main benefit to KNARTs is that you can share them with other
            healthcare organizations in a standardized manner that they can take and implement
            within their own EHR, if they choose.</para>
