    <title>Terminology Intro</title>
    <para>The desiderata for the design of a controlled healthcare vocabulary was first published in
        1989 with seven items and was expanded in 1998 to a list of twelve desiderata in the paper
        by JJ Cimino <citation>Desiderata for Controlled Medical Vocabularies in the Twenty-First
            Century</citation>. These desiderata are used to describe desirable characteristics of
        controlled medical terminologies. They are:<itemizedlist>

                <para>Content</para>
                <para>While missing content is expected, formally stated processes for requesting
                    and adding content is required. SNOMED CT, LOINC and RxNorm all have formal
                    processes in place for requesting changes to the terminologies either through
                    the organization that maintains them or through a national release center in the
                    case of SNOMED CT. While content can be added using these formal processes,
                    there is usually a delay before a formal addition is available for use.  In
                    addition to the formal processes available through the standards development
                    organizations (SDOs), SNOMED CT includes formal mechanisms for users to extend
                    the terminology and add missing content locally.</para>

                <para>Concept orientation</para>
                <para>The most granular piece of a terminology must be a concept with a single
                    coherent meaning. Terms associated with a code should represent a single
                    concept.</para>
                <para>In the 1998 paper <citation>Representing Thoughts, Words, and Things in the
                        UMLS</citation> the authors describe that the Ogden Richards semiotic
                        triangle<quote> shows that, although written or spoken symbols (words)
                        cannot completely capture the essence of a reference (thought) or of a
                        referent (thing), there is a correspondence among them. Either a word or an
                        object can inspire a thought, and people may endeavor to express their
                        thoughts with words or by identifying objects in the world. The relationship
                        between a word and a thing is indirect, however. The link can be completed
                        only when an interpreter (usually a person) processes the word, which
                        invokes a corresponding thought, and then links that thought to a thing in
                        the world (the “referent”). This diagram is seductive in its
                        simplicity.</quote></para>
                <para><quote>By implying a one-to-one relationship between each pair of members in
                        the triangle, this simple diagram masks hidden complexity. Ogden and
                        Richards alluded to this complexity by the dotted line between a symbol and
                        a referent, indicating that the link between a symbol and a referent can
                        only be made indirectly through an interpreter, but the notion that a symbol
                        does—or could—refer to a single thought and that a thought does—or
                        could—refer to a single referent is a fallacy. Thus, it has been
                        historically recognized that multiple terms may refer to the same object or
                        idea, a single term may refer ambiguously to more than one object or idea,
                        and terms may be confusing because they are out of date. It is within this
                        context that we seek solutions to improve our ability to communicate about
                        biomedical concepts.</quote></para>

                <para>Concept permanence</para>
                <para>A concept's meaning cannot change, and concepts cannot be deleted after they
                    have been released. Once added to a terminology, concepts and their identifiers
                    should persist. However, a mechanism to make concepts inactive when they are
                    deemed to be duplicate or erroneous should be available.  Terminologies like
                    SNOMED CT and LOINC both have mechanisms for inactivating concepts after they
                    have been deemed to be in error.</para>

            <listitem>
                <para>Meaningless concept identifiers</para>
                <para>Concepts should use unique identifiers that do not contain any contextual
                    information about a concept. Identifiers should not include any hierarchical
                    information that would prevent changes in the concepts hierarchy without
                    retirement.</para>

            <listitem>
                <para>Polyhierarchy</para>
                <para>Concepts should be allowed to exist in multiple hierarchies if appropriate.
                    For example,

                <para>While hierarchical information is paramount, the inclusion of additional
                    definitional knowledge can help maintain and correctly place concepts within the
                    appropriate hierarchy. Allowing computers to use this additional information can
                    aid in properly placing concepts in hierarchies that developers did not
                    originally add to a concept.</para>

                <para>No residual categories (Reject "Not Elsewhere Classified")</para>
                <para>Since terminologies will never be completely finished, it is easy to reject
                    the concept orientation desiderata and begin to create or use concepts as
                    grouper categories for missing content. Doing so introduces a "semantic drift"
                    that will cause problems with properly identifying historical data. By assigning
                    meaning to a category, information is lost.  Rejecting these categories requires
                    the capability to extend content as described in the first desiderata.</para>

            <listitem>
                <para>Multiple granularities</para>
                <para>The ability to represent meaning occurs at various levels, depending on the
                    setting of care and users of the terminology. As care progresses, a more finer
                    grained concept may be required to more accurately represent the diagnosis.

                <para>In addition to representing meaning at various levels, the display of the
                    concepts that are relevant to certain users should be able to be customized.
                    Allowing users to view concepts in a way that is intuitive will support the
                    adoption of terminologies by making the terminology more
                    usable.<?oxy_comment_end?></para>

                <para>Terminologies should allow for the representation of the context in which the
                    concepts should be used. While some contextual information should not be
                    supported in the terminology (like date, time, names, etc), other contextual
                    information should be supported (for example severity and laterality).</para>

                    in terminologies is inevitable but should not be done radically or without clear
                    documented reasons for the change.  Changes should be carefully tested and
                    vetted by end-users. <?oxy_comment_end?></para>

                <para>Duplicate concepts should not exist in the terminology and processes should be
                    in place to both prevent and detect them. With large terminologies, it is
                    inevitable that duplicate and erroneous concepts are added. Robust terminologies
                    need processes and procedures in place to identify and retire duplicate and
                    erroneous concepts.  Multiple processes can be utilized to ensure redunant
                    concepts are not added to terminologies.  For example:<itemizedlist>
