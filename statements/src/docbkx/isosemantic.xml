    <title>Isosemantic Transformation</title>
    <para>Isosemantic models refer to models that may share a different structure but which are
        semantically equivalent. In order for two models to be isosemantic the models must support
        bidirectional transformations without any information loss. Isosemantic models allow models
        whose representations better address clinical requirements while retaining formal and
        detailed semantics. For instance, while a more post-coordinated information model may
        facilitate integration with existing systems, an interface model may favor greater
        terminology pre-coordination and a simpler structure that aligns better with the needs of an
        input form presented to a clinician. Typically, isosemantic models range between two poles -
        a highly detailed information model that makes little use of terminology pre-coordination
        and post-coordinated expressions and a highly simplified information model where most of the
        model representation resides in a fully post-coordinated terminology expression based on an
        underlying concept model. Many isosemantic models reside within this continuum.<footnote><para><link
