        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>There are two types of patterns, which can be used to represent clinical observations.
            The assertional pattern and the evaluation result pattern. The general difference
            between those patterns is that the evaluation result pattern is best used, where a topic
            is evaluated with multiple different evaluation results. These evaluation results would
            be represented in a value set. The application of an assertional pattern is more useful,
            where assertions about the patient, e.g. an observation of a diagnosis, are made and the
            result of the observation is either “present” or “absent”. In those cases, the topic of
            the observation is represented as pre-coordinated concepts rather than value sets. </para>
