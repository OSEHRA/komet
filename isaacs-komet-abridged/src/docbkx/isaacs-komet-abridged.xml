        <para>C/1680 V1, also called the Great Comet of 1680, Kirch's Comet, and Newton's Comet, has
            the distinction of being the first comet discovered by telescope. The orbit of C/1680
            V1, fit to a parabola, as shown in Isaac Newton's <emphasis>Principia</emphasis>. Isaac
            Newton used observations of C/1680 V1 to test and verify Kepler's laws of planetary
            motion. </para>

        <title>Introduction to SOLOR</title>
        <partintro> <para>Prior to discussion of SOLOR, the Department of Veterans Affairs's ISAAC (InformaticS
                Architecture Acceleration) must be referenced. ISAAC is an architecture framework
                that strives for a holistic approach to support an integrated delivery of iterative
                revisions of specifications, services, and
                <?oxy_comment_start author="soychoi" timestamp="20171101T173448-0400" comment="Do we want to be specific on the type of content or no?"?>content<?oxy_comment_end?>.
                ISAAC design philosophy calls for an approach that supports novelty within a
                rigorous—and vertically integrated—deployment pipeline and is based on existing
                software development best practices. Moreover, it embraces DevOps culture and
                practice by emphasizing collaboration and communication while automating the process
                of product delivery. The vision for development within the ISAAC framework is one
                that enables knowledge engineers, developers, testers, build managers, and
                operations personnel to work together effectively to deliver assets to the points of
                care and analysis. </para>
            <para>Within the ISAAC architecture, KOMET (KnOwledge Management EnvironmenT) defines a
                modular system and a service platform for clinical knowledge management that
                implements a complete and dynamic component model. KOMET provides an environment for
                the modularization of knowledge resources into bundles. Each bundle is a tightly
                coupled, dynamically loadable collection of terminology, terminological knowledge
                assertions, A-Box assertions regarding rules, transformation, and files that
                explicitly declare their external dependencies—if any. To support the content within
                the ISAAC architecture, SOLOR's main goal is to provide an open-source
                <?oxy_comment_start author="soychoi" timestamp="20171101T174023-0400" comment="Are we okay with saying &quot;platform&quot; for SOLOR?"?>terminology
                platfor<?oxy_comment_end?>m that cultivates the relationships between terminologies
                and allows knowledge to be shared in one consumable format. Moreover, it strives to
                remove the complexities of various content which are today delivered by isolated
                silo organizations who place the implementation burden upon their consumers.</para></partintro>
