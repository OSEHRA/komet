        <para>C/1680 V1, also called the Great Comet of 1680, Kirch's Comet, and Newton's Comet, has
            the distinction of being the first comet discovered by telescope. The orbit of C/1680
            V1, fit to a parabola, as shown in Isaac Newton's <emphasis>Principia</emphasis>. Isaac
            Newton used observations of C/1680 V1 to test and verify Kepler's laws of planetary
            motion. </para>

            <title>Document generation</title>
            <para>This document was authored in DocBookÂ 5.1, and generated with Apache Maven.
                Document modules are defined using Maven, and docbook xml files are published for
                each of these modules using standard maven methods and maven-compatible artifact
                repositories. These modules are then declared as maven dependencies for other
                document projects. The modules are unzipped and placed in the target directory,
                where they can be selectively included in dependent documents using the XIncludes
                methods. </para>

                annotations="systolic blood pressure (observable entity)"/>. The xml:id of the
                concept is a UUID of the concept. xref elements should use the annotations attribute
                to provide a human readable representation of the concept, preferably the fully
                specified name of the concept. In <xref linkend="solor_references"/>, concepts are
                represented as glossentry elements, with the fully-specified name of the concept
                represented as a glossterm element, and the preferred name of the concept
                represented as an acronym </para>
