            Manager, you can navigate to the area by selecting the "Manager" option in the
            navigation menu. The information in this section will provide an overview of the display

                this page, there should be a table that lists all users in the application along
                with filter options to aide in user search. Select the "New Account" button on this
                page.</para>

                Global in the application. Project-specific permissions can be assigned on the Edit
                Account Profile page after the account is created.</para>
            <para>In order for the new user to access the project contents, the account must be
                assigned the appropriate projects and roles, so after account creation, select the
                user from the View Accounts and Roles page. You can assign the requested projects to
