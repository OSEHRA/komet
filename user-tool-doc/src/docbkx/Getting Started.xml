    <title>Getting Started</title>
    <para>Whether you are brand new to creating and modifying medical terminology tools,
        MindComputing's Knowledge is an intuitive web application to use. This article will show you
        the fastest way to get the most value out of Knowledge by using key features, such as
        search, creating a new concept, and running the classifier but first we will describe the
        login process and the overall application layout.</para>

            <title>Accessing Knowledge for the First Time</title>
            <para>To access Knowledge Editor, you need a username and temporary password assigned to
                you by an administrator who has permissions to manage the application. You should
                receive login information and url in your e-mail.</para>
            <para>Once you log in, you may see one of two screens:<itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>

                        <para>If the administrator has not assigned projects to your account, you
                            can only edit your user profile, e-mail, and password. Contact your
                            administrator for project assignment.</para>

            <title>Application Layout</title>
        </info>
        <para>The Knowledge application is organized into 2 areas: Editor and Manager. The manager
            is only available to administrators, so we will lay out the Editor functionalities in
            this article.
        </para>
        <section>
            <title>Knowledge Editor</title>
            <para>The Editor is an interactive application that allows you to search, view, edit, and
                create terminologies, reference sets, and search criteria. By default, it is divided
                into 2 sections: the <emphasis role="bold">task</emphasis> pane and the <emphasis
                    role="bold">concept viewer</emphasis> pane. When you select a concept on the left
                task pane, its details can be viewed in the right details pane. <informalfigure>
                    <mediaobject>

                    </mediaobject>
                </informalfigure>You can optionally open another <emphasis role="bold">concept
                    viewer</emphasis> pane that will display on the far right side of the window. There
                are three ways to do so: <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>Right-click the concept you wish to review and select "<emphasis

                    <listitem>
                        <para>Highlight the concept you want to see in a new viewer and press "

        <section>
            <title>What can I do in the Editor?</title>
            <para>The Editor has tasks divided under 2 interfaces: Authoring and Export Management. You
                can access either of these interfaces in the top navigation anytime you are logged into
                the Editor.</para>

            <section>
                <title>Authoring</title>
                <para>The Authoring interface provides information on concepts and
                    terminologies, lists reference sets, queries, mapsets, enables user to run the
                    classifier, and allows user to search for items in the database. Depending on your
                    account permissions, there is also the ability to edit many of the previously mentioned
                    items.</para>
            </section>
            <section>
                <title>Export Management</title>
                <para>The Export Management interface is viewable by users who have Editing permissions.
                    Tasks such as QA runs, content releases, metric reports, and conflict resolutions
                    are done under this interface, but the Content Manager has permissions to create a
                    release version in this area.</para>

            <title>How do I find terminologies?</title>
            <para>You can search for terminologies under the Authoring interface. On the left pane,
                there are options to find the concepts directly in its taxonomy tree or to search for
                keywords.</para>
            <section>
                <title>Taxonomy Tree</title>
                <para>One of the ways to view terminologies or concepts is to locate the item in the
                    taxonomy tree in the left pane. Simply select the terminology you want to view
                    in its relationship tree. To expand a concept module, select the caret symbol on
                    the left of the tree to expand its children terminologies.</para>

                descriptions which include additional names it may be known by in other languages and
                dialects, and the axiom history which illustrates its taxonomy relationship. Details
                such as the inferred information or inactive items can be toggled on by selecting
                "Display options" in the upper right corner, and its refset relationships and history

        <title>Using the Briefcase</title>
        <para>A briefcase is where you can temporarily hold concepts so that you can review them
            later. For example, if you run the classifier and it identifies multiple duplicates, you
            may want to add them to your briefcase so that you can access the list of concepts
            quickly to compare. Or if you're reviewing the concept's associated members, the table
            may have an option to add them to your briefcase.</para>
        <para>To add a terminology to your briefase from some lists such as classifier page, select
            the briefacse icon (not all tables have this feature). Simply click on the briefcase
            icon to add or remove it from your list. Your briefcase is viewable in the left pane
            navigation.</para>
