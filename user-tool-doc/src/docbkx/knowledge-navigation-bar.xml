        <title>Export Content</title>
        <para>There are two types of exports that can be created: a local downloadable file, and a
            release version that is uploaded to the repository. Exports and releases created are
            specific to the module you are working on. Once a release is created, you have the
            option of downloading it onto your system.</para>
        <para>When an export is initiated, several steps happen in the background: the classifier is
            run, a QA check is performed, and then a file is packaged for download.</para>
        <para>To create an export, go to the Export Management interface and on the left pane there
            is a table of Exports and QA, filtered by Path. Select the "Actions…" dropdown and
            "Create an Export".</para>
        <para>A modal appears asking which path the release should be created under, the file type
            for export, and a few additional details. Select "Create" to confirm and execute the
            task.</para>

            Export Management workflow in order to upload content to the repository.</para>
        <para>To create a version release, go to the Export Management interface and on the left
            pane there is a table of Exports and QA, filtered by Path. Select the "Actions…"
            dropdown and "Create an Export". </para>
        <para>A modal appears asking which path the release should be created under, the file
            type for export, and a dialogue for release version. Check the box for release
            version, modify the version number if needed, then select "Create" to confirm and
            execute the task. The version number is automatically set to your current date in

                <para>Release statistics are a set of descriptive measures and statistics obtained
                    through automated queries with the objective of providing information on content
                    changes and temporal trends as a measurement of progress. You can download this

            <title>QA Tests</title>
            <para>QA Tests flag terminologies that have broken concept rules in the requested
                release/export, including domain attribute errors and description duplicates. This check
                can be run individually or as part of an export request. To do so, select the desired

                relationship tree categorizing the results for you to select from. When you select a
