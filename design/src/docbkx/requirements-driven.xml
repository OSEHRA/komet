        ><!--LIST OF STYLESHEET AND/OR BOOK-FILE EDITS TO MAKE:
       1.) GENERAL EDITS: Content from multiple PDF and Word sources has been added (see above) HOWEVER, this content needs to be reviewed and edited for inclusion into Principia Informatica.  Further, content will likely need to be moved around within and between files as part of the editing process. 
       1.) FIGURES: The tag-line/phrase listed below figures needs to be edited in the stylesheet so that it is visible in PDF output. Currently it only shows in Oxygen Text/Author view. 
            a.) The spacing around the image also appears too small, as some images show a light grey border on 3 out of 4 sides, vs. all sides. I believe this can be edited in stylesheet as well. 
            b.) Doublecheck in the book file that there is a Table of Figures, and Table of Tables, just as there is a Table of Contents showing Sections.  The table of Figures doesn't show in the Architectural Requirements file itself.
        2.) INDEX: An Index location needs to be created in Book file. 
        3.) HYPERLINKS: Need to edit stylesheet to format all links & hyperlinks so that they're visible in blue color with an underline in PDF output, for reader recognition/use of the embedded link/hyperlink features.  
            a.) This goes for web addresses shown in the text itself (often times in parenthases).           
            b.) This also goes for content that is hyper-linked to other sections within the document itself. 
            c.) Here is a link to how to customize a patch in stylesheet:  https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-4296
            d.) Currently, Tedra has italicized these links/hyperlinks, so that they're easier to find within Oxygen & the PDF output, for editing once stylesheet is updated. 
        4.) CUSTOMIZE ORDERLIST: Need to determine if it possible to customize an orderlist, so that the secondary listitems will show as bullets vs. number/letter format in the PDF output. (See Section 4: Enterprise Need/Justification for example.) 
        5.) CUSTOMIZE ITEMIZEDLIST: Need nested bullets to show as different bullet format in PDF output. (bullet & opencircle, etc.). I followed directions on tagging appropriately, but output doesn't correlate, so thinking this may need a stylesheet modification to work out the kinks. 
        6.) TABLES:  Need to customized stylesheet for template formatting of  table rows to show shaded rows. (Most tables should have every other row shaded, starting with heading).  
            a.) Also need to determine how to add itemized list (bullets) into a table row correctly.  I couldn't figure this out & get an error, though Oxygen does still allow for a PDF output with this error...
            b.) The Funding Request tables from the VA TERMINOLOGY SERVICE FINAL 8_18_2014 document need to be larger than the page currently allows, to acomodate the additional column spacing needed.  --><!--
        7.) SPACING: Need to customize stylesheet so that Lists (ItemizedLists/OrderedLists/VariableLists) are not broken apart over page breaks. There is a way to keep these together in stylesheet. 
            a.) Also need to do the same for Tables so that they don't break over a page break.
            b.) Look at Lists with sub-lists nested within, and determine if you like the spacing in the PDF output, or if you want to change. (I think the spacing looks a little wonky with each line evenly spaced, regardless of nested lines.)  (See Section 4: Enterprise Need/Justification for example.) 
            c.) Also take a look at Section 7.6: Related Projects or Work Effects, as the even spacing there is also wonky. Maybe can fix this in Stylesheet so that links are closer to the bold headings? 
        8.) FOOTNOTES: Need to left align footnotes. Currently Footnote #3 appears to be in justified alignment/spread out across page. Not sure how to fix, but thinking this may be the way? --></para>

        ><!-- ISSUES:
        1.) The footnotes from ordered list items (like requirements) don't show up on the bottoms of pgs. in PDF format.  I've since learned that Docbook considers footnotes a parent to orderedlists... could this be why?
        2.) Some footnotes in the document simply aren't showing up in the PDF output, and I'm not sure why, as I'm convinced the markup tags are identical with other footnotes in the file that show up fine. (See Section 5.2.1: Status Time Author Module Path (STAMP) Versioning
Component Database, as this issue appears to start there.)   I've additionally commented the areas where the footnotes appear faulty in Oxygen. --></para>

            inconsistently. For example, some concepts have the term “intubation” in the FSN,
            however, they are modeled with an attribute relationship specifying a value of
            “Insertion – action (qualifier value).” The reverse is also true: concepts with the term

                crafted application is deployed properly, companies too often rely on manual
                deployments or scripts that are manually updated each time, or both. In any case,
                time and effort are wasted in the release process, and increased potential for
                errors and botched deployments results. Application lifecycle-management processes
                and best practices in release management must be considered as integral to the
                entire process. Working together, release management and service management can

                    tuberculous-arthritis differs from that of bacterial-arthritis in two respects.
                    The first difference, the causative-agent of mycobacterium-tuberculosis-complex
                    is sufficient to define the concept . However, the nature of the inflammation
                    that results is, necessarily, granulomatous.</para>

                    than equivalent to tuberculous-arthritis. This computation occurs because the

                HL7 Reference Information Model (RIM) as an appropriate foundation for application
                architecture. [14] However, the HL7 RIM has also been described as an “incoherent
                standard” with “obstacles [that] are insurmountable” and that “the time has come to
                abandon an unworkable paradigm.” [15] This later sentiment is consistent with our
                own experience. </para>

                </info> A Classifier defines a type. Type conformance between generalizable
                Classifiers is defined so that a Classifier conforms to itself and to all of its
                ancestors in the generalization hierarchy. Class is a kind of classifier whose
                features are attributes and operations. Attributes of a class are represented by
                instances of Property that are owned by the class. Some of these attributes may
                represent the navigable ends of binary associations. </para>

                </info> Type is therefore defined by the Classifier and its generalization
                relationships not by Class Properties. However if for complexity of the model all
                the instances of say Medication have the same attributes and behavior (operations)
                then an attribute can be used to identify a medication using terminology. All the
                rules for structure and behavior are contained in the Medication type class. </para>

                aware of the problems and criticisms of the RIM, and in April 2011, the HL7 Board
                authorized a “fresh look” task force to focus on how interoperability could be
                better achieved. This task force resulted in the Clinical Information Modeling
                Initiative (CIMI), an effort that is currently focusing on detailed clinical models
                rather than defining integrative architecture. [16] The ability to represent CIMI
                developed models may provide validation use cases for informatics architecture, but
                CIMI does not have a candidate architecture to build upon at this time. </para>
