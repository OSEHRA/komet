    <title>Concrete Domains</title>

    <section>
        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>Concrete domains can be used in SNOMED CT to represent and reason over values like
            integers in Description Logic. Our initial work focused on medications and evaluating
            the use of concrete domains to represent not only the product strength, but also the
            unit of use size. To fully test the feasibility of concrete domains, additional
            attributes were also added, in order to fully represent all information regarding
            medications, which will then allow concepts to be fully defined. Thus, this will enable
            testing the equivalence and subsumption of concepts by the Description Logic classifiers
            within the tooling.</para>
        <para>At the beginning of the project there was no ability to represent numeric attributes
            of concepts in SNOMED CT, which made machine readability of numeric attributes
            difficult, prone to error, and left a large portion of Products as primitive concepts.
            Without the ability to fully represent the numeric properties, equivalence checking and
            subsumption using the Description Logic classifier is not possible. With the
            introduction of the new Drug Concept Model in the July 2017 International Release the
            representation of product strength and units will begin to be modelled over the next few
            releases. However, this new Drug Concept Model does not utilize concrete domains but
            instead creates the strength numbers as concepts themselves to be used as values for the
            product strength attributes. </para>

        <title>Approach</title>
        <para>By using a lexical search for string containing integers and textual representation of
            integers, 10,114 potential Pharmaceutical / Biologic Product concepts were identified,
            which were modeled with the proposed attributes including one attribute to represent
            product strength. To properly represent the numeric information contained in these
            products, the Australian Medicines Terminology Approach that applied to its Australian
            extension content and not to the International SNOMED CT content was utilized.</para>
        <para>To speed up the modeling process, already available data around strength and units
            from NDF-RT through RxNorm RXNSAT relationships that was linked to the SNOMED CT
            concepts through the RXCUI was used. Technical validation was performed on these values
            and any incorrect strength or units we identified were corrected before using these
            values to populate the relationships. After loading the new relationships into the
            terminology editor, further manual review was conducted to verify the relationships and
            add any missing information.</para>
        <para>Using the findings from the drug modeling, the team evaluated other hierarchies that
            were identified as having potential for modeling concrete domains.</para>
